# Waterhole

iNaturalist is missing a friendly feed on the iOS app and a mobile-layout for its [Following webpage](https://www.inaturalist.org/home?tab=following). Waterhole is an attempt to fill that gap, although just for me; it currently (manually) follows the users that I follow.

Waterhole is just an experiment. If it feels right, I'll mention it to the fine folks at iNaturalist and see if they have similar ideas and/or if I can help.

## Usage

1. Run live-server
2. Uncomment `console.log(item)` or refer to the official [docs](https://api.inaturalist.org/v1/docs/) for available parameters
