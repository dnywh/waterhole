# Waterhole

iNaturalist is missing a friendly feed on the iOS app and a mobile layout for its [Following webpage](https://www.inaturalist.org/home?tab=following). Waterhole is an attempt to fill those gap, although just for me; it currently (manually) follows the users that I follow.

Waterhole is just an experiment. If it feels right, I'll mention it to the fine folks at iNaturalist and see if they have similar ideas and/or if I can help.

## Installation

1. Run live-server
2. Uncomment `console.log(item)` or refer to the official [docs](https://api.inaturalist.org/v1/docs/) for available parameters

## Usage

1. Open [waterhole.netlify.app](https://waterhole.netlify.app)
2. ~~Sign in to iNaturalist~~ (coming soon)
3. Save to your home screen or bookmark page
